\title{Example Data for the Crossover Encouragement Design}
\format{
A data frame containing the following variables, which are 
  interpreted as results from a hypothetical randomized trial employing the 
  crossover encouragement design. 
\describe{
  \item{T1:}{ The binary treatment indicator in the first stage.}
  \item{M1:}{ The binary mediator variable recorded in the first stage.}
  \item{Y1:}{ The binary outcome variable recorded in the first stage.}
  \item{T2:}{ The binary treatment in the second stage. Equal to 1 - T1 by 
  design.}
  \item{Z:}{ The binary encouragement indicator for the second stage.}
  \item{M2:}{ The binary mediator recorded in the second stage.}
  \item{Y2:}{ The binary outcome recorded in the second stage.}

}
\description{
A randomly generated dataset containing 2000 rows and 7 columns with no 
missing values.
}
\details{
Note that all the observed responses are generated from an 
  underlying distribution of potential outcomes and mediators (not shown in 
  this dataset) satisfying the assumptions described in Imai, Tingley and 
  Yamamoto (2012).
