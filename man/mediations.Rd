\arguments{
\item{datasets}{a named list of data frames. Each data frame has a separate 
treatment variable. The names of each data frame must begin with the exact 
name of the treatment variable that is contained in that dataset (see 
example below).}

\item{treatment}{a vector of character strings indicating the names of the 
treatment variables, with length equal to the length of 'datasets'. Each 
treatment variable must be included in the data frame listed in the same 
position of list 'datasets' and its name must match the first part of the 
corresponding data frame.}

\item{mediators}{a vector of character strings indicating the names of the 
mediators contained within each data frame. All of the mediators will be 
used with each treatment variable and hence must be included in each data 
frame of 'datasets'.}

\item{outcome}{a vector of character strings indicating the names of the 
outcome variables contained within each data frame. All of the outcomes
will be used with each treatment variable and must be in each data frame.}

\item{covariates}{a character string representing the set of pre-treatment 
covariate names (as they appear in the data frame) to be included in each 
model. The value must take the form of standard model formula, with each 
additive component separated by "+", etc. (see example below). All 
covariates must be in each data frame. Default is 'NULL'.}

\item{families}{a vector of length two specifying the types of the mediator 
and outcome models. Currently only supports "gaussian" (for linear 
regression), "binomial" (for binary probit), "oprobit" (for ordered probit)
and "quantile" (for quantile regression, see 'tau'). For the outcome the 
tobit model ("tobit") is also available in addition to the mediator model 
options.}

\item{tau.m}{a numeric value specifying the quantile to be used for a 
quantile regression for the mediator model. Only relevant if the first 
element of 'families' is "quantile". See \code{rq}.}

\item{tau.y}{a numeric value specifying the quantile to be used for a 
quantile regression for the outcome model. Only relevant if the second 
element of 'families' is "quantile". See \code{rq}.}

\item{LowerY}{a numeric value indicating the lower bound for the tobit 
outcome model. See \code{tobit}.}

\item{UpperY}{a numeric value indicating the upper bound for the tobit 
outcome model. See \code{tobit}.}

\item{interaction}{a logical value indicating whether the treatment and 
mediator variables should be interacted. This will apply to applications of
\code{\link{mediate}} to all the treatment/mediator/outcome combinations.}

\item{conf.level}{confidence level used in each application of the 
\code{\link{mediate}} function.}

\item{sims}{an integer indicating the desired number of simulations for 
inference. This will apply to all applications of 'mediate' to all the 
treatment/mediator/outcome combinations.}

\item{boot}{a logical value, indicating whether or not nonparametric 
bootstrap should be used in each \code{\link{mediate}} application.}

\item{weights}{a single valued vector of a character string indicating a 
weight variable to be used in all model fitting.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed to \code{\link{mediate}}, such as 
'robustSE', 'dropobs', etc.}
}
\value{
An object of class "mediations" (or "mediations.order" if the outcome
  model is ordered probit), a list of "mediate" ("mediate.order") objects
  produced by applications of \code{\link{mediate}} for the specified 
  treatment/mediator/outcome combinations.  The elements are named based on 
  the names of the outcome, treatment, and mediator variables, each separated
  by a "." (see example below).
}
\description{
'mediations' can be used to process a set of outcome/treatment/mediator 
combinations through the \code{\link{mediate}} function to produce a series 
of causal mediation analysis results.
}
\details{
This function processes multiple treatment/mediators/outcome
  variable combinations to produce a collected set of output ready for
  analysis or graphing. In principle, this is a function designed to
  facilitate running causal mediation analyses on multiple models that share
  the same basic specification (i.e. the types of parametric models and the
  set of pre-treatment covariates) except the treatment, mediator and outcome
  variables can differ across specifications. The function works by looping 
  over a set of data frames that are pre-loaded into the workspace. Each one 
  of these data frames has a specific treatment variable that is used for 
  analysis with that data frame. Then the code runs causal mediation analysis
  via \code{\link{mediate}} on every combination of the treatment, mediator, 
  and outcomes specified in these arguments. This allows the users to explore
  whether different mediators transmit the effect of the treatment variable
  on a variety of outcome variables. A single set of pre-treatment control 
  variables can be specified in 'covariates', which will be used throughout.
  
  The 'mediations' function can be used with either multiple mediators and a 
  single outcome, a single mediator and multiple outcomes, or multiple 
  mediators and outcomes. For example, with three different treatments, user 
  will create three different data frames, each containing a treatment 
  variable. In addition, if there are also four different mediators, each of 
  these will be contained in each data frame, along with the outcome
  variable. The function will estimate all of the combinations of treatment
  variables and mediators instead of separate lines of code being written for
  each one.
  
  Individual elements of the output list (see "Value") may be passed through 
  \code{\link[=summary.mediate]{summary}} and 
  \code{\link[=plot.mediate]{plot}} for tabular and graphical summaries of
  the results. Alternatively, the entire output may be directly passed to 
  \code{\link[=summary.mediations]{summary}} or 
  \code{\link[=plot.mediations]{plot}} for all results to be inspected.
  
  The default value of 'covariates' is 'NULL' and no covariate will be 
  included in either mediator or outcome models without a custom value. It 
  should be noted that users typically should have pre-treatment covariates
  to make the sequential ignorability assumption more plausible.
  
  There are several limitations to the code. First, it works only with a 
  subset of the model types that will be accommodated if 'mediate' is used 
  individually (see the 'families' argument above for details). Second, one 
  cannot specify separate sets of covariates for different 
  treatment/mediator/outcome combinations. Users should use 'mediate' 
  separately for individual models if more flexibility is required in their 
  specific applications.
