\title{Estimating Average Causal Mediation Effects under the Crossover Encouragement
Design}
\usage{
mediate.ced(
  outcome,
  med.1,
  med.2,
  treat,
  encourage,
  data,
  sims = 1000,
  conf.level = 0.95
)
}
\arguments{
\item{outcome}{variable name in 'data' containing the outcome values observed
in the second experiment. The variable must be binary (factor or numeric
0/1).}

\item{med.1}{variable name in 'data' containing the mediator values observed 
in the first experiment. The variable must be binary (factor or numeric 
0/1).}

\item{med.2}{variable name in 'data' containing the mediator values observed 
in the second experiment.}

\item{treat}{variable name in 'data' containing the treatment values in the 
first experiment. Must be binary (factor or numeric 0/1).}

\item{encourage}{name of the encouragement indicator in 'data'. Must be 
binary (factor or numeric 0/1).}

\item{data}{a data frame containing all the above variables.}

\item{sims}{number of bootstrap simulations.}

\item{conf.level}{level of the returned two-sided confidence intervals.}
}
\value{
\code{mediate.ced} returns an object of class 
  "\code{mediate.design}", a list that contains the components listed below.
  
  The \code{summary} function can be used to obtain a table of the results.
  
  \item{d0, d1}{point estimates of the average indirect effects under the control and treatment conditions.}
  \item{d0.ci, d1.ci}{confidence intervals for the effects. The confidence level is set at the value specified in 'conf.level'.}
  \item{conf.level}{ confidence level used.}
  \item{sims}{ number of bootstrap simulations.}
  \item{nobs}{ number of observations used.}
  \item{design}{ indicates the design. Always equals "CED".}
}
\description{
'mediate.ced' estimates the average causal mediation effects for the 
crossover encouragement design.
}
\details{
This function estimates the average indirect effects for the pliable
  units under the crossover encouragement design. The design has two stages. 
  In the first stage the treatment is randomized and the mediator and outcome
  variables are measured. In the second the treatment is set to the value 
  opposite of first period and a randomly selected group of units receives 
  encouragement to take on the mediator opposite to the values observed in 
  the first stage.  See Imai, Tingley and Yamamoto (2012) for a full 
  description. The confidence intervals are calculated via the nonparametric 
  bootstrap.
  
  Note that \code{outcome} should be the observed responses in the
  \emph{second} stage whereas \code{treat} should be the values in the
  \emph{first} stage.
